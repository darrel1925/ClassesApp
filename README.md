# TrackMy - a fun app I made :)

## What
TrackMy is an app I built in college. It tracks the classes you need and notifies you as soon as a seat opens up.

You can set notifications for when waitlists open or when a seat in the class becomes available.

## Why
I hated our class enrollment system. I could never get into the classes I needed. So, I built this app to solve it.

## How
A combination of web scraping and browser automation :)

## Extra ‚≠êÔ∏è
For close friends, I built a bot that would log you into your portal and auto-enroll you into any class you needed.

I did not release this to the public. I was afraid of getting in trouble with the university üòÖ

## Result
‚Ä¢ A few hundred downloads
‚Ä¢ A lot of thankful friends and classmates
‚Ä¢ Made about $50 from premium subscriptions

## Where is TrackMy now
Unfortunately, I took it down from the app store. When it became popular, I began my summer internship. Fixing bugs and staying ahead of my school's changing bot protection was too much to handle while working full time.

TrackMy was used by me and my friends for about 4-5 months. It was released to the public for another 4-5 months. You'll always be kept in the loop.
